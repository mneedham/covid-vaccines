= COVID-19 vaccinations in the UK

This is a https://streamlit.io/[Streamlit^] application that makes it easier to visualise the number of COVID-19 vaccinations done in the UK across different dimensions.

== Getting Started

If you want to try it out, you'll need to first clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:mneedham/covid-vaccines.git
cd covid-vaccines
```

=== Install Dependencies

I use https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/[pipenv^] to manage my projects.
If you do too, you can install dependencies by running the following command:

```
pipenv shell
```

If not, you can install the dependencies using pip directly, as shown below:

```
pip install pandas streamlit 
```

=== Running the application

Once you have the dependencies install, you can launch the Streamlit app using the following command:

```
streamlit run analyse.py
```

Now, naviage to to http://localhost:8501
