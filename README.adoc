= COVID-19 vaccinations in the UK

This is a https://streamlit.io/[Streamlit^] application that makes it easier to visualise the number of COVID-19 vaccinations done in the UK across different dimensions.

It is deployed at https://share.streamlit.io/mneedham/covid-vaccines/main/analyse.py

== Getting Started

If you want to try it out, you'll need to first clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:mneedham/covid-vaccines.git
cd covid-vaccines
```

=== Install Dependencies

I use https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/[pipenv^] to manage my projects.
If you do too, you can install dependencies by running the following command:

```
pipenv shell
```

If not, you can install the dependencies using pip directly, as shown below:

```
pip install pandas streamlit 
```

=== Running the application

Once you have the dependencies install, you can launch the Streamlit app using the following command:

```
streamlit run analyse.py
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.86.26:8501
```

Now, navigate to http://localhost:8501 to view the app.
If everything has worked, you should see something like the screenshot below:

== The Data

The data is in the https://github.com/mneedham/covid-vaccines/tree/main/data[data] directory and was downloaded from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations. 

* The data for "People who have received 1st dose vaccinations, by report date" is saved as `data/data_<date>-dose1.csv`
* The data for "People who have received 2nd dose vaccinations, by report date" is saved as `data/data_<date>-dose2.csv`
